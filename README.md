**Spam Classifier** 

This project aims to create a classifier that can separate spam from non-spam email messages. [The dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase) from UCI Machine Learning Repository is used for this project. 
Before running Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), the data is partitioned into training and validation sets  in 80-20 proportion. Also, the data set is standardized using the Caret package.
